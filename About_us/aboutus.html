            <h2>Our Stationery Shop's History</h2>
            <p>In August 2005, OKAY Stationery Store was established in Malacca.</p>
            <p>At the beginning, our stationery shop was not well known, but once the demand for correction liquid gradually increased,</p>
            <p>while other stationery shops did not provide this stationery, our shop became the only stationery seller with correction liquid.</p>
            <p>After that, more and more people came to our store to buy, which led to a sharp increase in business.</p>
            <p>From then on, our shop began to sell more and more stationery and gained the support of many people.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>2012 was a challenging year for our stationery shop beacause we opened two branches in Kuala Lumpur and Johor respectively.</p>
            <p>Our store has also attracted many customers because of its comprehensive range of stationery products and has become the stationery store with the highest sales volume.</p>
            <p>However, the outbreak caused a significant drop in sales.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In 2019, decreasing sales due to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic also had a huge impact.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the store created a website to facilitate customers to buy stationery online.</p>
            <p>With the launch of the website, stationery sales gradually increased.</p>
            <p>Until now, more and more people use our website to buy the stationery they need in order not to go out.</p>

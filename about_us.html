        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <div class="background2">
            <p>In August 2005, OKAY Stationery Store was established in Malacca. At the beginning, our stationery shop was not well known, but once the demand for correction liquid gradually increased, while other stationery shops did not provide this stationery, our shop became the only stationery seller with correction liquid. After that, more and more people came to our store to buy, which led to a sharp increase in business. From then on, our shop began to sell more and more stationery and gained the support of many people.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>2012 was a challenging year for our stationery shop beacause we opened two branches in Kuala Lumpur and Johor respectively. Our store has also attracted many customers because of its comprehensive range of stationery products and has become the stationery store with the highest sales volume. However, the outbreak caused a significant drop in sales. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>In 2019, decreasing sales due to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic also had a huge impact. Therefore, the store created a website to facilitate customers to buy stationery online. With the launch of the website, stationery sales gradually increased. Until now, more and more people use our website to buy the stationery they need in order not to go out.</p>
